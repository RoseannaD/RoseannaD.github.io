	<P>Magic finds us kicking up the dust along the road </P>
	<P>Silence travels farther than a story often told </P>
	<P>Vagabond I've been, and vagabond I'll always be, </P>
	<P>running down the devil at every crossroads that I see. </P>
	<P>I never thought to be called back to a home that I outgrew, </P>
	<P>but the summer's gone, the call is strong and there's something I must do. </P>
	<P>Thought I knew all of the stories that a Southern girl could know </P>
	<P>but there's a dream of Mississippi that I never tell a soul. </P>
	<P>There's a boy there with his arms outstretched to me when I pass by. </P>
	<P>Some days, I wish my heart were dead, too tired to even cry. </P>
	<P>When missing him is all I do, the days all pass me by </P>
	<P>like these dreams of Mississippi and these ghosts who cannot lie. </P>
	<P>Oh, this ring rests on my finger like a veve on a wall </P>
	<P>and whispers gather 'round me, come to dance when darkness falls. </P>
	<P>Everything I see adds up to say the tale is tall, </P>
	<P>but back into his arms is really not that far to fall. </P>
	<P>There is moonlight on the river where I never thought I'd go. </P>
	<P>There's a dream of Mississippi that I never tell a soul. </P>
	<P>At night, I swear I feel him, and so my eyes stay closed. </P>
	<P>The distance brings us closer now than ever I supposed. </P>
	<P>Who knows? </P>
	<P>So I'm going where the sunshine shimmers right through summer's end, </P>
	<P>where the heat will lay you out before the harvest comes to mend. </P>
	<P>A world I thought was done with me has called me back again </P>
	<P>with these dreams of Mississippi and this ghost who calls me friend. </P>
	<P>There is moonlight on the river where I never thought I'd go. </P>
	<P>There's a dream of Mississippi that I never tell a soul. </P>
	<P>Thought I knew all of the stories that a Southern girl could know. </P>
	<P>There's a dream of Mississippi that I never tell a soul. </P>
