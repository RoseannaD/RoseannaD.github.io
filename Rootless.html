	<p>Shield brother calls to beg me </p>
	<p>get a message to his girl </p>
	<p>ancestors stirring, sending messages </p>
	<p>through our own across the world </p>
	<p>I am listening, I am following </p>
	<p>as warriors of the light can only do</p> 
	<p>we ride rootless </p>
	<p>on heavy medicine </p>
	<p>every day until our lives are through </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>CHORUS 1</p>
	<p>we ride rootless on heavy medicine </p>
	<p>disconnected from the ground </p>
	<p>we ride rootless in dark places </p>
	<p>unafraid that we might fall or die or drown </p>
	<p>we are working, we are tireless </p>
	<p>we are seekers of the way </p>
	<p>we ride rootless on heavy medicine </p>
	<p>and we live to fight another day </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Time to do the work while my bones and blood are wild </p>
	<p>with lessons learned and secrets shared </p>
	<p>Friends and lovers help me put my armor back together </p>
	<p>and never let me leave home unprepared </p>
	<p>My comrade sets his fiddle to his shoulder </p>
	<p>and I know today there'll be no turning back. </p>
	<p>We'll ride rootless </p>
	<p>on heavy medicine </p>
	<p>unashamed of what we lack </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>CHORUS 2 </p>
	<p>We ride rootless on heavy medicine </p>
	<p>disconnected from the ground </p>
	<p>We ride fearless in dark places </p>
	<p>hearts in danger but our spirits safe and sound </p>
	<p>We are working, we are tireless </p>
	<p>singing songs to stir the sky </p>
	<p>We are honor bound to share these visions </p>
	<p>walking tall and getting by </p>
	<p>walking tall when we don't fly </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Dirt beneath my nails </p>
	<p>I claw my way home from the forest </p>
	<p>just as crazy as before </p>
	<p>but I am breathing and I am laughing </p>
	<p>taking one step at a time </p>
	<p>bringing truth from door to door </p>
	<p>and I'm not the only one </p>
	<p>one of many </p>
	<p>unafraid to open eyes or heart or mind </p>
	<p>We ride rootless </p>
	<p>on heavy medicine </p>
	<p>and we do it all the time </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>CHORUS 3</p> 
	<p>We ride rootless on heavy medicine </p>
	<p>disconnected from the ground </p>
	<p>We ride windward across the wasteland </p>
	<p>skin in danger but our hearts all safe and sound </p>
	<p>We speak the language of song and shadow </p>
	<p>We are tenders of the flame </p>
	<p>We ride rootless </p>
	<p>on heavy medicine </p>
	<p>and from day one we've never been the same</p> 
	<p></p>
	<p>CHORUS 4 </p>
	<p>We are healers working retail </p>
	<p>or working graveyard without pay </p>
	<p>We tell stories in our circle </p>
	<p>We listen or we dance or we just pray </p>
	<p>We are working, we are tireless </p>
	<p>We are teachers of the way </p>
	<p>We ride rootless on heavy medicine </p>
	<p>and we walk it every day </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>CHORUS 1 </p>
	<p></p>
	<p></p>
	<p>END COUNTERMELODY:</p> 
	<p>we are here so the stories get told </p>
	<p>don't give up ride out be bold </p>
	<p>build the fire bright and strong </p>
	<p>speak your truth and sing your song </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>you are here so the stories get told </p>
	<p>goddess bless your weary soul </p>
	<p>raise your voice to call the cry </p>
	<p>storytellers never die </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>goddess bless your weary heart</p> 
	<p>tried and tested, torn apart </p>
	<p>holding hands around the flames </p>
	<p>healed and whole we rise again </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>goddess bless your weary soul</p> 
	<p>we are here so the stories get told </p>
	<p>and we live to fight another day</p>
