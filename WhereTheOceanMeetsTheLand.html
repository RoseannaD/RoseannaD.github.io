	<p>She came to find me, little scion of the nerve, </p>
	<p>with sea foam seeded innocence, all milkiness and verve </p>
	<p>and a heart like a lion hell bent on what it wanted, </p>
	<p>regardless of the hell to pay. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>I warned her that the surface was no fairy tale come true, </p>
	<p>that love can do more damage than you think that it can do, </p>
	<p>but she bade me name my price, and so </p>
	<p>I left her mute and haunted, </p>
	<p>winsome in the light of day. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Where the ocean meets the land, </p>
	<p>grit your teeth and stand upon </p>
	<p>your own two feet, my darling. </p>
	<p>Do take care. </p>
	<p>Guard your precious heart </p>
	<p>in the verdant world apart if you're </p>
	<p>gonna leave the water for the air. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>I kept a distant eye on the new life she was building, </p>
	<p>betting on a love who seemed unhearing and unyielding, </p>
	<p>but her will, like a lion, was too wild for backing down </p>
	<p>or for sensing the time to take wing. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>When her sisters came to see me with their </p>
	<p>wide and tearful eyes, </p>
	<p>the best that I could offer was a blade for her to try </p>
	<p>for stopping the heart that would never bow down </p>
	<p>to a siren who could not sing. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>This is why, my minnow, </p>
	<p>I've been loath to let you go. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Where the ocean meets the land, </p>
	<p>grit your teeth and stand upon </p>
	<p>your own two feet, my darling. </p>
	<p>Do take care. </p>
	<p>Guard your precious heart in </p>
	<p>the verdant world apart if you're</p> 
	<p>gonna leave the water for the air. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Every word is true. </p>
	<p>You'll do what you have to do. </p>
	<p>I know your spirit cannot stay </p>
	<p>inside its shell, </p>
	<p>but I'll be watching from the deep</p>
	<p>when you wake and as you sleep. </p>
	<p>Take the knife before you leave </p>
	<p>and use it well.</p>
