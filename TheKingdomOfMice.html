	<p>In the beginning there was dust, dust, dust </p>
	<p>But we will eat the yellow as we must, must, must </p>
	<p>When we eat the sun, will it taste like mouse? </p>
	<p>We swear by the dust we shall soon find out! </p>
	<p>In the beginning there was dust, dust, dust </p>
	<p>But we will eat the Weaver as we must, must, must </p>
	<p>When we eat the sun, will it taste like mouse? </p>
	<p>We swear by the dust we shall soon find out! </p>
	<p>Dust was first, then yellow came along </p>
	<p>Viceroy Baldtail golden in the throng </p>
	<p>Long live Baldtail, eaten in a trice </p>
	<p>All for the glory of the kingdom of the mice </p>
	<p>In the beginning there was dust, dust, dust </p>
	<p>But we will eat the yellow as we must, must, must </p>
	<p>When we eat the sun, will it taste like mouse? </p>
	<p>We swear by the dust we shall soon find out! </p>
	<p>Yellow came first, then green came along </p>
	<p>Purple met its end in the bellies of the throng </p>
	<p>Blackwhisker and Dustbelly made their sacrifice  </p>
	<p>All for the good of the kingdom of the mice </p>
	<p>There in the middle, there is dust, dust, dust </p>
	<p>But we will eat the purple as we must, must, mustv
	<p>When we eat the sea, will it taste like mouse? </p>
	<p>We swear by the dust we shall soon find out! </p>
	<p>Yellow, green, and purple, crimson to come </p>
	<p>We deserve better than the dust, our home </p>
	<p>Manglepaw came and we ate him up dead </p>
	<p>There in the dust at the feast of red </p>
	<p>In the end, there is dust, dust, dust </p>
	<p>But we will eat the red as we must, must, must </p>
	<p>When we eat the city, will it taste like mouse? </p>
	<p>We swear by the dust we shall soon find out! </p>
	<p>Down with the dust and the Weaver's eyes! </p>
	<p>Down with the spider with her belly full of flies! </p>
	<p>We will take the brightest road </p>
	<p>And taste of the world as we tasted gold </p>
	<p>In the beginning there was dust, dust, dust </p>
	<p>But we will eat the colors as we must, must, must </p>
	<p>When we eat the world, will it taste like mouse? </p>
	<p>We swear by the dust we shall soon find out </p>
	<p>We swear by the dust we shall soon find out </p>
	<p>We swear by the dust we shall soon find out </p>
	<p>We swear by the dust </p>
	<p>We swear by the dust </p>
