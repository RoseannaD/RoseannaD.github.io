	<p>I feel this magic come and wrap around me like a vine.</p>
	<p>Lover, can you trust yourself to believe in lullabies?</p>
	<p>I don't know who's wilder. I don't really have to try</p>
	<p>to know all of the answers. I will hold you by and by.</p>
	<p>Lover, let me stay a while, and I'll weave you lullabies.</p>
	<p>You are laid so low with loving me, you can barely see the sky,</p>
	<p>but love, you're not the only one needing holding when you cry.</p>
	<p>I don't know the road ahead. I don't really have to try</p>
	<p>to hold all of the answers. I'll just hold you by and by.</p>
	<p>Lover, could you put a little faith in lullabies?</p>
	<p>I feel your magic coming. Wrap it 'round me like a vine.</p>
	<p>Lover, let me stay a while. Put your trust in lullabies.</p>
	<p>I don't know who's wilder. I don't really have to try</p>
	<p>to know all of the answers. I will know you by and by.</p>
	<p>Lover, can you trust me, and believe in lullabies?</p>
	<p>Oh, lover, let me stay a while, and I'll weave you lullabies.</p>
