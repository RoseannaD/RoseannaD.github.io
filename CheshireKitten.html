	<p>I grew up seeing things a little differently, appearing </p>
	<p>Disappearing, hardly innocent, nor </p>
	<p>Tied down to the ground </p>
	<p>I learned to roll and tumble with the punches </p>
	<p>Glory in my stripes and spots </p>
	<p>Walk by invisible and never make a sound </p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>But heavy is the crown that's always hidden </p>
	<p>Tender is the heart you never see </p>
	<p>Hard and fast shines the grin that we flash, but there's a vulnerable stripe or two on me </p>
	<p>Maybe any place outside of Wonderland </p>
	<p>Is not for me, my friend </p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>If I leave my grin behind, remind me </p>
	<p>That we're all mad here </p>
	<p>And it's okay </p>
	<p>Sun up, sun down the shadows hide me down in  </p>
	<p>Wonderland, Wonderland, nobody knows the way </p>
	<p>But if you find it in your dreams, you can </p>
	<p>Find it at your dayjob </p>
	<p>Somewhere south of Hell </p>
	<p>Take the path to left or right with </p>
	<p>Just your gut to guide you </p>
	<p>The story is not for anyone else to </p>
	<p>Tell </p>
	<p>Go down the rabbit hole and out the other side </p>
	<p>You can't go home in the middle of the </p>
	<p>Magic carpet ride </p>
	<p>You gotta greet the sun before his </p>
	<p>Lovely daughter moon </p>
	<p>You can't forsake the journey for the </p>
	<p>Safety of your room </p>
	<p>Until you learn your lesson well </p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>I have learned to see and hear </p>
	<p>Everybody loud and clear </p>
	<p>But the truth comes out in riddles that are </p>
	<p>Safe enough to share </p>
	<p>That's how it is in songs, you see </p>
	<p>And stripes always look good on me </p>
	<p>Whether or not I'm really there (smile hangs in the air) </p>
	<p>But heavy is the burden of the wise ones </p>
	<p>When no one understands a word they say </p>
	<p>The Jabberwock never bothered anyone </p>
	<p>But nobody believes him to this day </p>
	<p>And why should they? </p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>If I leave my grin behind, remind me </p>
	<p>We're all mad here </p>
	<p>And it's ok </p>
	<p>Sun up, sun down the shadows find me out in </p>
	<p>Wonderland, Wonderland, nobody knows the way </p>
	<p>But if you find it in your dreams </p>
	<p>You can find it at your dayjob </p>
	<p>Somewhere south of Hell </p>
	<p>Take the path to left or right with </p>
	<p>Just your gut to guide you </p>
	<p>The story's not for anyone else to </p>
	<p>Tell </p>
	<p>You gotta go down the rabbit hole and </p>
	<p>Out the other side </p>
	<p>You can't go home in the middle of the </p>
	<p>Magic carpet ride </p>
	<p>You gotta greet the sun before his </p>
	<p>Lovely daughter moon </p>
	<p>You can't forsake the journey for the </p>
	<p>Safety of your room </p>
	<p>Until you learn your lesson well </p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Is it the stripes or the spots you see? </p>
	<p>Was it hearts or diamonds, baby, led you here to me? </p>
	<p>Darling, you know better than to trust a pack of cards! </p>
	<p>What have we learned </p>
	<p>The world is never as mad as it could be </p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>If I leave my grin behind, remind me </p>
	<p>We're all mad here </p>
	<p>And it's ok! </p>
