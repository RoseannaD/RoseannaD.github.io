	<p>Inspired by a moment on a dance floor when the bottom fell out, and everything changed. </p>
	<p>Lost my reason on the dance floor on a sultry summer night, </p>
	<p>took a turn to Billie Holiday and dared to hold you tight.</p>
	<p>Standing at the edge, you say, "It's gonna be all right.</p>
	<p>Baby, don't you let the dream go down, go down."</p>
	<p>Swapping songs for cigarettes underneath a summer moon, </p>
	<p>we watch each other moving to an easy autumn tune.</p>
	<p>Now every time I turn around, it seems that I'll be leaving soon,</p>
	<p>but don't you let the dream go down, go down.</p>
	<p>I can almost touch it now.</p>
	<p>Can't you see me reaching out?</p>
	<p>Mustn't ever let this fire go out.</p>
	<p>Baby, don't you let the dream go down.</p>
	<p>Crazy is how things have been</p>
	<p>underneath my selkie skin</p>
	<p>ever since you let me in.</p>
	<p>Baby, don't you let the dream go down.</p>
	<p>Perhaps I'm steering sideways 'cause I haven't got a clue,</p>
	<p>just another dreamer with an awful lot to prove.</p>
	<p>I only know I love you, and I love the way you move.</p>
	<p>Baby, don't you let the dream go down, go down</p>
	<p>Like my reason on the dance floor on a sultry summer night.</p>
	<p>Took a turn to Big Bad Gina and I dared to hold you tight.</p>
	<p>Standing at the edge, I guess it better be all right.</p>
	<p>Baby, don't you let the dream go down, go down.</p>
	<p>Baby, don't you let the dream go down.</p>
