	</p>Burn me out, draw the lightning down  </p>
	</p>Stand up, face your equal  </p>
	</p>Turn this world around  </p>
	</p> </p>
	</p>Go on and burn me out,  </p>
	</p>catch me if you can, I'm gonna  </p>
	</p>draw the lightning down  </p>
	</p>Coming bold or meek,  </p>
	</p>stand and face your equal, and we'll  </p>
	</p>turn this world around, oh  </p>
	</p> </p>
	</p>(Burn me out, draw the lightning down  </p>
	</p>Stand up, strowler  </p>
	</p>Turn this world around)  </p>
	</p> </p>
	</p>Call me an outcast, call me a thief  </p>
	</p>Close your eyes to my whole magic show  </p>
	</p>Turn away from what I have to say  </p>
	</p>The powerless have powers you will never know  </p>
	</p>We're all just storytellers  </p>
	</p>dreaming out loud to pass the time  </p>
	</p>I know my enemy shares my own fragility  </p>
	</p>but if you've got the spark, you're  </p>
	</p>bound to get fire  </p>
	</p> </p>
	</p>Go on and burn me out,  </p>
	</p>catch me if you can, I'm gonna  </p>
	</p>draw the lightning down  </p>
	</p>Coming strong or weak,  </p>
	</p>stand and face your equal, and we'll  </p>
	</p>turn this world around  </p>
	</p> </p>
	</p>Call me a criminal for what I hold inside  </p>
	</p>Behind your eyes you know we are the same  </p>
	</p>Problem child or spirit of solution,  </p>
	</p>revolution doesn't need a lot of flame.  </p>
	</p>Call on the Storyteller, what's in the cards for you?  </p>
	</p>I know the choice is clear:  </p>
	</p>compassion over fear for the  </p>
	</p>magic we can do  </p>
	</p> </p>
	</p>Go on and burn me out,  </p>
	</p>catch me if you can, I'm gonna  </p>
	</p>draw the lightning down  </p>
	</p>Coming strong or weak,  </p>
	</p>stand and face your equal, and we'll  </p>
	</p>turn this world around  </p>
	</p> </p>
	</p>Call me an outcast, call me a thief  </p>
	</p>Close your eyes to my whole magic show  </p>
	</p>Turn away from what I have to say  </p>
	</p>The powerless have powers you will never know  </p>
	</p>If you don't have the spark you'll  </p>
	</p>never see fire, but we've got the match right here  </p>
	</p>Let the world awake. Make no mistake  </p>
	</p>we will still be standing when the  </p>
	</p>smoke has cleared  </p>
	</p> </p>
	</p>Go on and burn me out,  </p>
	</p>catch me if you can, I'm gonna  </p>
	</p>draw the lightning down  </p>
	</p>Coming bold or meek,  </p>
	</p>stand and face your equal, and we'll  </p>
	</p>turn this world around  </p>
	</p>Go on and burn me out,  </p>
	</p>catch me if you can, I'm gonna  </p>
	</p>draw the lightning down  </p>
	</p>There's only one ride  </p>
	</p>if we're gonna survive, we gotta  </p>
	</p>turn this world around  </p>
	</p> </p>
	</p>We may be out of focus, but we're  </p>
	</p>proud to let it show  </p>
	</p>We burn without the burning and we  </p>
	</p>do not care who knows  </p>
	</p>Try to kill what's beautiful,  </p>
	</p>stand back and watch it grow  </p>
	</p>Got a different kind of burning and we  </p>
	</p>do not care who knows  </p>
	</p>  </p>
	</p>Renegades and rascals, we are  </p>
	</p>all the same as you  </p>
	</p>standing up for magic and the  </p>
	</p>magic we can do  </p>
	</p>Try to hide the mystery, it's  </p>
	</p>gonna shine through  </p>
	</p>We stand up for magic and the  </p>
	</p>magic we can do  </p>
	</p> </p>
	</p>Burn me out, draw the lightning down  </p>
	</p>Stand up, face your equal  </p>
	</p>Turn this world around </p>
