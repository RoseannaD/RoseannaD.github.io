	<p>Just because it isn't real </p>
	<p>doesn't mean it isn't true </p>
	<p>If someone said it wasn't real </p>
	<p>They don't see the way you do </p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>If I told you I believed you, </p>
	<p>what stories would you tell? </p>
	<p>Would you feel a little stronger? </p>
	<p>Would you step out of your shell </p>
	<p>or would you say it wasn't real </p>
	<p>until I left you alone? </p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Once upon a time, did someone </p>
	<p>try to take it away from you? </p>
	<p>Did you fight for what was real to you? </p>
	<p>I know that you do. </p>
	<p>Well, once upon a time is now </p>
	<p>and the story's come back for you </p>
	<p>so show me what you can do. </p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>If someone said it wasn't true </p>
	<p>doesn't mean it isn't real </p>
	<p>You know it behind your eyes </p>
	<p>and in all that you feel </p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>If I tell you I believe you, </p>
	<p>what stories would you share? </p>
	<p>Would you feel a little stronger? </p>
	<p>Would you say that you don't care, </p>
	<p>or tell me, "no, no, no, no no! </p>
	<p>Please leave me alone!" </p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Well, we've all got a different </p>
	<p>right and wrong </p>
	<p>So we break a little law </p>
	<p>or we sing a different song </p>
	<p>Who says what's real, what's right, </p>
	<p>and what is true? </p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Once upon a time, you </p>
	<p>lived by the rhyme of </p>
	<p>the things you knew </p>
	<p>So why don't you show me </p>
	<p>what you can do. </p>
	<p>Come on and show me </p>
	<p>what you can do!</p>
