	<p>"Who do you belong to, little girl? </p>
	<p>Why do you wander in the deep, dark wood?" </p>
	<p>It's not an easy answer, I'm afraid. </p>
	<p>She fits your little story, but she's up to no good. </p>
	<p>Growing up means growing into war, </p>
	<p>waiting to be broken just to understand, </p>
	<p>going where you've never gone before, </p>
	<p>changing into devil just as fast as you can. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Wolves shall croon in your merciless ear. </p>
	<p>Don't believe everything that you hear. </p>
	<p> your color high and tilt your head just so. </p>
	<p>Maybe nobody will know. </p>
	<p>Who is more a dragon or a danger? Who's to say?</p> 
	<p>Stolen fairytale girls never get to take the easy way. </p>
	<p>A danger and a devil disguised as a child at play, </p>
	<p>Masha raises her head to say, </p>
	<p>"I belong to me. Even now, even here, I belong to me." </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Drink the souls of songbirds, little girl. </p>
	<p>Spin your lie like thread and suck the music down.</p> 
	<p> to hardness all you will. </p>
	<p>Everybody knows that you're from out of town. </p>
	<p> the devil never to let go, </p>
	<p>mixing hell and romance just like any other fool. </p>
	<p>Wisely, you must heed a sister's words: </p>
	<p>love comes down to nothing more than who is to rule.</p> 
	<p></p>
	<p>Coral coaxes, red compels, </p>
	<p>green for daring, blue for bargains fell.</p> 
	<p>You are dear to me, and I'll never tell </p>
	<p>how afraid you are. </p>
	<p>Shouldering a rifle, more to prove with every breath, </p>
	<p>stolen fairytale girls make the difference between life and death.</p>
	<p>It all comes down to choices, but you've only the hard ones left, </p>
	<p>and so, all you can say is </p>
	<p>"I belong to me. Even now, even here!" </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>So when he comes a-courting with a kingdom in his hand, </p>
	<p>clever fairytale girls strike the hardest of all bargains. </p>
	<p>As long as love's around, we'll tell the story again and again.</p> 
	<p>I think this is where I came in. </p>
	<p>I belong to me. Even now, even here. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>"Who do you belong to, little girl? </p>
	<p>Why do you wander in the deep, dark wood?" </p>
	<p>It's not an easy answer, I'm afraid. </p>
	<p>I may fit the story, but I'm up to no good.</p>
