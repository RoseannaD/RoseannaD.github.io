	<p>A-B-C-D-E-F-G </p>
	<p>H-I -J -K ELL! </p>
	<p>Just a little different, just a little shy </p>
	<p>A heart so big and red as mine is difficult to hide </p>
	<p>I know I come on pretty strong, </p>
	<p>But I'll be your better shadow if you let me tag along </p>
	<p>It's a strange place to be, but I know my way around. </p>
	<p>Not a soul here can fly, but there are riches on the ground </p>
	<p>so don't you dare be afraid. I am here by your side </p>
	<p>It's confusing out there, but I won't leave you high and dry. </p>
	<p>Ask me anything </p>
	<p>and I'll help you find your way. </p>
	<p>For adventuring, </p>
	<p>this could be your lucky day! </p>
	<p>Never fear, my dear. </p>
	<p>If the answer isn't plain to see, </p>
	<p>cross-reference and you'll find </p>
	<p>the key! </p>
	<p>Just a little funny, just a little loud, </p>
	<p>know-how enough to do a library proud. </p>
	<p>I know I talk too much sometimes, </p>
	<p>But tell me all your wishes and I'll listen every time! </p>
	<p>It's a strange place to be when you don't know where you're bound, </p>
	<p>But I'll walk right beside you, and I'll never let you down! </p>
	<p>Oh, let all the lions threaten me! </p>
	<p>Courage follows friendship to the bottom of the sea! </p>
	<p>Ask me anything, </p>
	<p>and I'll help you find your way. </p>
	<p>For adventuring, </p>
	<p>this could be your lucky day! </p>
	<p>Never fear, my dear. </p>
	<p>If the answer isn't plain to see, </p>
	<p>cross-reference and you'll find it! </p>
	<p>Twelve of twenty-six and one of three makes me, </p>
	<p>lemon ices melting by degrees. </p>
	<p>Soon we'll lose our chains and we will </p>
	<p>all fly free. </p>
	<p>Never fear and put your trust in me! </p>
	<p>I will walk and I will dance, </p>
	<p>but flying's got to wait </p>
	<p>until I'm not the only one, </p>
	<p>and joy can never come too late! </p>
	<p>It's a strange place to be when you cannot spread your wings, </p>
	<p>but even bound as we are, we can do all sorts of things! </p>
	<p>So don't you dare be afraid. Just you hold your head up high. </p>
	<p>Never mind the ones who tell you you're too big and bold and bright! </p>
	<p>ASK ME ANYTHING, </p>
	<p>and I'll help you find your way! </p>
	<p>For adventuring, </p>
	<p>this could be your lucky day! </p>
	<p>Never fear, my dear! </p>
	<p>If the answer isn't plain to see, </p>
	<p>cross-reference and you'll find </p>
	<p>the key! </p>
