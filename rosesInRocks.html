	<p>If the roses in the rocks can bloom, </p>
	<p>then I'd better get to bloomin' too. </p>
	<p>Persist, Resist, and Bloom. </p>
	<p>Persist, Resist, and Bloom. </p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>If the roses in the rocks can bloom, </p>
	<p>then I'd better get to bloomin' too. </p>
	<p>If the roses in the rocks can bloom, </p>
	<p>so can I. </p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Not like it's rocket science, </p>
	<p>or even prickly pear marinade. </p>
	<p>You know what they say about life and lemons. </p>
	<p>Pour me some of that lemonade. </p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Rich vs. Poor ain't nothing new. </p>
	<p>Artists and fools still speaking truth to power, </p>
	<p>well what about you? </p>
	<p>Yeah, what about you? </p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>See, I'm not afraid to fight for change. </p>
	<p>I am here to be the change we wanna see. </p>
	<p>Springtime comes on back around. </p>
	<p>Blossom feeds the honeybees and </p>
	<p>sweet little seeds keep breaking free.</p> 
	<p></p>
	<p>If the roses in the rocks can bloom, </p>
	<p>then I'd better get to bloomin' too. </p>
	<p>Persist, Resist, and Bloom. </p>
	<p>Persist, Resist, and Bloom. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>If the roses in the rocks can bloom, </p>
	<p>then I'd better get to bloomin' too. </p>
	<p>If the roses in the rocks can bloom, </p>
	<p>so can I. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>It's hard to kill a rosebush. </p>
	<p>Why would you wanna try? </p>
	<p>We all share the water, </p>
	<p>the starry sky, the food supply, </p>
	<p>so grow your thorns, my people. </p>
	<p>We've still got plenty of sun. </p>
	<p>We are the wild and rainbow roses </p>
	<p>whose colors will not run. </p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Wild roses keep on climbing, </p>
	<p>no matter who's in charge. </p>
	<p>Our truth has always been here. </p>
	<p>The future still is ours. </p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Wild roses keep on growing, </p>
	<p>no matter who's in charge. </p>
	<p>Our truth has always been here. </p>
	<p>The future still is ours. </p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Wild roses keep on blooming </p>
	<p>no matter who's in charge. </p>
	<p>Our truth has always been here. </p>
	<p>The future still is ours! </p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Better get to bloomin'. </p>
	<p>Persist, Resist, and bloom. </p>
	<p>If the roses in the rocks can bloom, </p>
	<p>then I'd better get to bloomin' too. </p>
	<p>If the roses in the rocks can bloom, </p>
	<p>so can I! </p>
